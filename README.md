Breathe some life into your ASP.NET MVC applications using KnockoutJs. This talk will show you how to inject real interactivity into a typical MVC application responsibly: with minimal changes, without creating a maintenance nightmare, and without repeating yourself. Using the knockout mapping plugin in conjunction with JSON.NET, we will demonstrate how to build up the javascript bindings using your exisitng C# models and eliminate unnecessary page transitions without
rewriting your views.
